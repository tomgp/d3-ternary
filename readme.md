A couple of things to help make [ternary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot) plots in [d3](http://www.d3js.org)

The two things 

1. A scale _tgp.d3.plot()_ that converts ordered triplets into x/y coordinates based on a range property (also you can draw lines).

2. An axis renderer which takes a _plot_ and draws a triangle with subdivisions. TO DO: add axis labels.

Have  a look at index.html for example usage
